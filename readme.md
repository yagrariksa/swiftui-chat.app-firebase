# Real-Time Chat Application - SwiftUI Project


## Overview

Welcome to my SwiftUI project, a real-time chat application designed to showcase my skills in iOS development. This project demonstrates my ability to build a dynamic and interactive chat interface using SwiftUI and Firebase, a real-time database and authentication service.

## Project Description

This SwiftUI-based chat application is a comprehensive demonstration of a real-time chat system. Here are the key features I've implemented:

1. **Authentication**: Users can register and log in using their email and password. Firebase Authentication is used to securely manage user accounts.

2. **Chat Interface**: Once logged in, users can initiate and participate in real-time chat conversations. Conversations are organized by users, and each chat displays messages in a conversation-style bubble format.

3. **Search Functionality**: The app includes a search bar that allows users to search for other users to start new chat conversations with.

4. **Firebase Integration**: Data, including chat messages and user authentication, is securely stored and synchronized in Firebase, ensuring real-time updates across devices.

5. **Auto-Scroll**: The chat interface automatically scrolls to display new chat messages, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## Usage Instructions
To experience the project:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Xcode or your preferred SwiftUI development environment.

3. Firebase Setup: To ensure a smooth experience for the reviewer, I've pre-configured Firebase with a test environment. **However, to protect sensitive data, I should not included the Firebase API key directly in the project.** For now i include the Firebase API key in GoogleService-Info.plist so reviewer doesn't need to setup Firebase. But if you want to set up by yourself, please follow these steps to set up Firebase:

   1. Go to the Firebase Console.

   2. Create a new Firebase project (if you don't have one already).

   3. Add an iOS app to your project, and follow the setup instructions to download the GoogleService-Info.plist file.

   4. Place the downloaded GoogleService-Info.plist file in the root directory of this project.

4. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

5. Explore the chat app features.

   1. Register an account or log in using your email and password.

   2. Use the search bar to find other users and start new chat conversations.

   3. Enjoy real-time chat functionality, including auto-scrolling to view new messages.
